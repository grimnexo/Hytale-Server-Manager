# Hytale Modding Overview

This project targets Hytale's server-first modding model. Even in single-player, Hytale runs a local server; all modding is done via server plugins and asset packs rather than client-side mods. Asset packs and server plugins can be combined to change gameplay, assets, and behavior. Hytale's public stance is that the client should remain consistent and secure, while servers provide the creativity and variation. Visual scripting and creator tools are planned; traditional text scripting is not part of the official plan today.

## Modding Categories

- Server plugins (Java JARs)
- Data assets (JSON-driven assets)
- Art assets (models, textures)
- Save files and prefabs

## Legal / EULA (High-Level)

Hytale's EULA explicitly permits creating and sharing mods, including plugins, scripts, and custom content, as long as you follow the EULA's restrictions (do not redistribute original game files or misrepresent official status).
